Experiment 3 – Designing Multivariate Patterns
Objective

To explore and visualize relationships among multiple health indicators in a healthcare dataset using multivariate analysis techniques.

Scenario

The dataset contains health parameters such as Age, BMI, Glucose Level, and Blood Pressure. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, correlations, and age-group differences through multivariate visualizations.

Tools Used

R programming language

R packages: ggplot2, GGally, dplyr

In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Data Preparation

Created an Age_Group variable to categorize patients into Young, Middle-aged, Senior, and Elderly.

Cleaned and prepared data for plotting and correlation analysis.

2. Multivariate Visualization

Used a scatter plot matrix to explore pairwise relationships among Age, BMI, Glucose Level, and Blood Pressure.

Applied color and transparency to differentiate Age Groups.

3. Correlation Analysis

Computed a correlation matrix to quantify linear relationships among health indicators.

Features of the Analysis

Visual representation of multiple variables simultaneously

Differentiation by age groups using color coding

Identification of correlations and patterns among health indicators

Outcome

The multivariate analysis provided clear insights into relationships between health metrics, highlighted trends across age groups, and facilitated a better understanding of patient health patterns.
