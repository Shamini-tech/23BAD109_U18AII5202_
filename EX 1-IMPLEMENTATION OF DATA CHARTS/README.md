Experiment 1 – Implementation of Data Charts
Objective

To create and analyze various data charts for visualizing student performance, enabling insights into subject‑wise scores, test trends, and grade distribution.

Scenario

The dataset contains student performance records including internal test scores, subjects, and final grades. Visualization helps interpret performance patterns efficiently.

Tools Used

R programming language

R packages: ggplot2, dplyr

In‑Lab Tasks Performed
1. Bar Chart

Displayed subject‑wise average internal marks to compare performance across subjects.

2. Line Plot

Plotted average scores across internal tests to observe performance trends between Test 1 and Test 2.

3. Pie Chart

Visualized grade distribution to show the proportion of students in each grade category.

Features of the Analysis

Clear visual representation of student performance

Easy comparison across subjects and tests

Quick understanding of grade spread in the class

Outcome

The charts provided meaningful insights into academic performance, highlighted trends in test results, and showed how grades are distributed among students.
