Experiment 2 – Implementation of Data Visualization Techniques
Objective

To apply various data visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing e-commerce transaction data effectively.

Scenario

The dataset contains e-commerce transactions with variables like Transaction Amount and Transaction Date. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, monthly sales trends, and distribution characteristics using visualizations.

Tools Used

R programming language

R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate

In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Histogram

Created a histogram to examine the distribution of transaction amounts and identify common transaction ranges.

2. Boxplot

Generated a boxplot to visualize the spread of transaction amounts and detect outliers.

3. Heatmap of Monthly Sales

Converted Transaction Date to Date format and extracted Month.

Aggregated total sales by month.

Created a heatmap to highlight monthly sales intensity, showing peak and low sales periods.

Features of the Analysis

Visualization of distribution and trends in e-commerce transactions

Detection of outliers and sales patterns

Easy identification of high and low sales months

Outcome

The visualizations provide insights into customer transaction behavior, distribution of transaction amounts, and monthly sales trends, supporting data-driven decision-making for e-commerce operations.
