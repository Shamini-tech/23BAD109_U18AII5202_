Experiment 4 – Visual Encoding of Data
Objective

To apply visual encoding techniques to represent traffic accident data effectively, enabling analysis of accident severity, frequency, and type across different locations.

Scenario

The dataset contains traffic accident records, including Accident Type, Severity, and Location. Visual encoding is used to highlight patterns, trends, and high-risk areas through size, color, and shape of plot elements.

Tools Used

R programming language

R package: ggplot2

In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Data Preparation

Converted categorical variables into factors for proper plotting.

Ordered Severity levels as Minor, Serious, and Fatal.

Calculated accident frequency per location, severity, and accident type.

2. Visual Encoding

Used color to represent accident severity.

Used size to represent accident frequency.

Used shape to distinguish accident types.

3. Plot Design

Created a scatter plot showing accident frequency by location.

Applied custom colors for severity levels and adjusted point sizes for clarity.

Implemented minimal theme for clean visualization.

Features of the Analysis

Intuitive visual representation of multiple variables in one plot

Highlights high-risk locations and severe accidents

Differentiates accident types clearly through shape

Outcome

The visual encoding allows quick identification of critical locations, accident severity patterns, and frequency hotspots, aiding traffic safety analysis and decision-making.
