Experiment 6 – Implementation of Multivariate Displays
Objective

To visualize and analyze relationships between multiple variables in a retail dataset using multivariate display techniques.

Scenario

Adventure Works retail data requires exploration of sales and profit patterns across customer segments and regions. Multivariate displays help identify trends, outliers, and segment-wise performance efficiently.

Tools Used

R programming language with packages: GGally, ggplot2, lattice.

In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Parallel Coordinates Plot

Visualized Sales and Profit across different Customer Segments using a parallel coordinates plot for comparative analysis.

2. Bubble Chart

Plotted a bubble chart of Sales vs Profit, with bubble size representing Sales and color representing Region, to detect high-performing segments and regions.

3. Trellis Display

Created a faceted scatter plot (trellis display) of Sales vs Profit grouped by Customer Segment and split by Region for detailed multivariate comparison.

Features of the Analysis

Standardized multivariate visualizations

Segment-wise and region-wise comparison

Insights into trends, patterns, and outliers

Outcome

The multivariate displays provide clear insights into how Sales and Profit vary across Customer Segments and Regions, helping support data-driven decisions and marketing strategies.
